# What type of relationship (composition, aggregation, association, or dependency) do the following describe?
## a) An Animal class that contains an animal type (enum) and name (string).
## Ans: Composition -- The animal type and name don’t have a use outside of the Animal.

## 1b) A text editor class with a save() function that takes a File object as an argument. The save() function writes the contents of the editor to disk.
## Ans: Dependency -- The text editor class is using the File object for the task of saving to disk.

## Ans: Aggregation -- The computer has a CPU, but does not manage its existence.

## 1f) A blacksmith has a specific anvil that he uses to do his work.
## Ans: Association -- The blacksmith uses the anvil, but does not have a whole-part relationship with it.

## Select one: If you can design a class using (composition, aggregation, association, or dependency), then you should.
## Ans: composition
