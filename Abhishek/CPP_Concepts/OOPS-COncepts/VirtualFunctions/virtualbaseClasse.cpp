/**
 * @file virtualbaseClasse.cpp
 * @author Abhishek
 * @brief Here we discuss about the following:
 * 1- Diamond problem.
 * **NOTE**
 * There are a few rules to this virtual base classes:
 * 1- virtual base classes are always created before non-virtual base classes, which ensures all bases get 
 * created before their derived classes.
 * 
 * 2- note that the Scanner and Printer constructors still have calls to the PoweredDevice constructor. 
 * When creating an instance of Copier, these constructor calls are simply ignored because Copier is responsible 
 * for creating the PoweredDevice, not Scanner or Printer. However, if we were to create an instance of Scanner 
 * or Printer, those constructor calls would be used, and normal inheritance rules apply.
 * 
 * 3- If a class inherits one or more classes that have virtual parents, the most derived class is responsible for constructing 
 * the virtual base class. In this case, Copier inherits Printer and Scanner, both of which have a 
 * PoweredDevice virtual base class. Copier, the most derived class, is responsible for creation of PoweredDevice. 
 * Note that this is true even in a single inheritance case: if Copier singly inherited from Printer, and Printer 
 * was virtually inherited from PoweredDevice, Copier is still responsible for creating PoweredDevice.
 * 
 * 4- all classes inheriting a virtual base class will have a virtual table, even if they would normally 
 * not have one otherwise, and thus instances of the class will be larger by a pointer.
 *  Because Scanner and Printer derive virtually from PoweredDevice, Copier will only be one PoweredDevice 
 * subobject. Scanner and Printer both need to know how to find that single PoweredDevice subobject, so they can 
 * access its members (because after all, they are derived from it). This is typically done through some virtual 
 * table magic (which essentially stores the offset from each subclass to the PoweredDevice subobject).
