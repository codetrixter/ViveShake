/**
 * @file smartPointers.cpp
 * @author Abhishek
 * @brief here we discuss the usefullness of smart pointers(Composition Class):
 * 1- These help prevent memory leaks, as can be seen in someFunction(), as it terminates the local variable Auto_ptr's destructor is called which 
 * deallocates the memory.
 * 2- For supporting copy ctor and assignment operators, we implemented move semantics for the objects which only allows one object of Auto_ptr
 * to have valid values at a time, which helps avoid double free error that we saw in above case.
 * 
 * The Auto_ptr2 represents std::auto_ptr which was depricated in c++11 and removed in c++17, following were its flaws:
 * 1- Because std::auto_ptr implements move semantics through the copy constructor and assignment operator, passing 
 * a std::auto_ptr by value to a function will cause your resource to get moved to the function parameter (and be destroyed at the end of the 
 * function when the function parameters go out of scope). Then when you go to access your auto_ptr argument from the caller (not realizing it was 
 * transferred and deleted), you’re suddenly dereferencing a null pointer. Crash!
 * 2- std::auto_ptr always deletes its contents using non-array delete. This means auto_ptr won’t work correctly with dynamically allocated 
 * arrays, because it uses the wrong kind of deallocation. Worse, it won’t prevent you from passing it a dynamic array, which it will then mismanage, 
 * leading to memory leaks.
 * 3- auto_ptr doesn’t play nice with a lot of the other classes in the standard library, including most of the containers and algorithms. 
 * This occurs because those standard library classes assume that when they copy an item, it actually makes a copy, not a move.
