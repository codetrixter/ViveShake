/**
 * @file functionTryBlock.cpp
 * @author Abhishek
 * @brief Here we discuss the concept of function try blocks:
 * 1- function try blocks can catch both base and the current class exceptions.
 * NOTE:
 * ONE: When construction of an object fails, the destructor of the class is not called. Consequently, you may be tempted to use a function try 
 * block as a way to clean up a class that had partially allocated resources before failing. However, referring to members of the failed object 
 * is considered undefined behavior since the object is “dead” before the catch block executes. This means that you can’t use function try to 
 * clean up after a class.
 * SECOND: Function try is useful primarily for either logging failures before passing the exception up the stack, or for changing the type of 
 * exception thrown.
