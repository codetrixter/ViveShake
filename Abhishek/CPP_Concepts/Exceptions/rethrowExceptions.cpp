/**
 * @file rethrowExceptions.cpp
 * @author Abhishek
 * @brief Here we discuss about rethrowing exceptions:
 * 1- This is used when, you may run into a case where you want to catch an exception, but not want to (or have the ability to) fully handle 
 * it at the point where you catch it.
 * 2- When rethrowing the same exceptions, use the throw keyword by itself.
