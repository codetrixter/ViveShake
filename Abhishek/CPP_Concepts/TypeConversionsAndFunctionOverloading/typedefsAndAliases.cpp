 * @brief Here we discuss the uses of type aliases and typedef and their differences:
 * 1- These are not the new types, just an alternate name for the existing types in c++.
 * 2- The scope of type aliases remains the same as the data type it is refering to.
 * 3- typedef is still used in c++ for historical reasons, but their use is discouraged.
 * 4- type aliases can be used for platform independant coding.
 * 5- type aliases make complext data types, simple to write and understand.
 * 6- type aliases can also be used to give meaning to the returnm types, since using the tyoes alone will 
 * not tell the user what the return values is for.
 * 7 - tyoe aliases also makes the code maintenance easier in the sense that, if a tyoe needs to be
 * chnaged/modified it can be done by making chnage at oneplace where the aliasing is done.
