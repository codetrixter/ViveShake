 * @file dynamicCasts.cpp
 * @author Abhishek
 * @brief Here we discuss about the Dynamic casts:
 * 1- In an inheritance scenario where we want to call derived class non-virtual member using Base pointer.
 *  There are two ways of solving the above problem and call the derived class members"
 *  a. put the member of the derived in the Base class as virtual.
 *  b. downcast the Base pointer to derived pointer, which is the opposite of upcasting (converting derived 
 * to base pointer) which is done implicitly by the compiler. This is done via dynamic_cast
 * NOTE** Always check for the null pointer on the result of the dynamic cast.
 * 
 * Also note that there are several cases where downcasting using dynamic_cast will not work:

    a- With protected or private inheritance.
    b- For classes that do not declare or inherit any virtual functions (and thus don’t have a virtual table).
    c- In certain cases involving virtual base classes (see this page for an example of some of these cases, 
    and how to resolve them).

   2- the static cast works as well where the dynamic casting is used, but there is a caveat,
   the static cast does no runtime type checking to see if the conversion makes any sense or not, hence we 
   might get undefined behaviour or seg fault. 

   3- Dynamic casting works with reference as it worked with pointers, the only difference is when the casting is 
   unsuccessfull an std::bad_cast exception is thrown since there is no such thing as null reference.

   ******************
   Downcasting vs virtual functions::

    In general, using a virtual function should be preferred over downcasting. However, there are times when 
    downcasting is the better choice:

    a.When you can not modify the base class to add a virtual function (e.g. because the base class is part 
    of the standard library)
    b.When you need access to something that is derived-class specific (e.g. an access function that only 
    exists in the derived class)
    c.When adding a virtual function to your base class doesn’t make sense (e.g. there is no appropriate value 
    for the base class to return). Using a pure virtual function may be an option here if you don’t need to 
    instantiate the base class.

   A warning about dynamic_cast and RTTI::

    Run-time type information (RTTI) is a feature of C++ that exposes information about an object’s data type at runtime. This capability is leveraged by dynamic_cast. Because RTTI has a pretty significant space performance cost, some compilers allow you to turn RTTI off as an optimization. Needless to say, if you do this, dynamic_cast won’t function correctly
