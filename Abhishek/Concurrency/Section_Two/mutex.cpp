/**
 * @file mutex.cpp
 * @author Abhishek
 * @brief Here we discuss about the mutex and how to use it for thread synchronization:
 * 1- mutex(stands for mutual excusion), provides mutual exclusive access to the shared object to more than one threads.
 *  a. lock: locks the mutex, blocks if the mutex is not available.
 *  b. try_lock: tries to lock the mutex, returns is mutex is not available.
 *  c. unlock: unlocks the mutex.
 * EXAMPLE: List or most of the STL data structures are not thread safe, hence if more than one thread tries to access or insert data into 
 * the list, then there is a chnace that the data can be currupted or removed without notice.
 *  In the below example, when two threads try insert an elemnt to the front of the list then in some cases the element inserted by one thread 
 * be overwritten by another thread.
