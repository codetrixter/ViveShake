 * @brief Destructor use and purpose:
 * 1- Whenever an dynamically allocated object goes out of scope the destructor is called for 
 * graceful deallocation of the memory. hence it called just before the memory is deallocated.
 * 2- Destruct does not have any return value or parameters and can only be defined once per class. 
 * 
 * The below example also demostrates RAII(Resource Acquisation Is Initialization)
 * which basicall means that when the resource is acquired then only it is initialized and 
 * it is deallocated when no more in use. We achieve this via contructors and Destructors.
