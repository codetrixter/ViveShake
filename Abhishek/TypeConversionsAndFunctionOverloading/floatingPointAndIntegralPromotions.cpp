 * @brief Here we discuss the Numeric promotions:
 * 1- This type of promotion a narrower numeric type is converted to a wider numeric type.
 * 2- All numeric promotions are value preserving meaning there is no loss od data or precision.
 * Numeric promotions are of two type:
 * 1- Integral 
 * 2- Floating point
 * Integral Promotion:
 *  - signed char or signed short can be converted to int.
    - unsigned char, char8_t, and unsigned short can be converted to int if int can hold the entire range of the type, or unsigned int otherwise.
    - If char is signed by default, it follows the signed char conversion rules above. If it is unsigned by default, it follows the unsigned char conversion rules above.
    - bool can be converted to int, with false becoming 0 and true becoming 1.
 * Floating Point promotion:
    - value of type float can be converted to double.
