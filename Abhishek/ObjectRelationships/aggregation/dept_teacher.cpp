 * @brief Here we discuss about Aggregation concept of OOPs:
 * 1- To qualify as an aggregation, a whole object and its parts must have the following relationship:
    1- The part (member) is part of the object (class)
    2- The part (member) can belong to more than one object (class) at a time
    3- The part (member) does not have its existence managed by the object (class)
    4- The part (member) does not know about the existence of the object (class)
 * 2- This is a "has-a" relationship
 * 3- If there are more than one teachers in our department class then we can store them in a vector, but since vector can't store references as they
 * cannot be reassigned, so we use std::reference_wrapper which make the onjects behave as reassignable references. 
 * 
 * Composition VS Aggregation::
 *  Compositions:
    - Typically use normal member variables
    - Can use pointer members if the class handles object allocation/deallocation itself
    - Responsible for creation/destruction of parts

    Aggregations:
    - Typically use pointer or reference members that point to or reference objects that live outside the scope of the aggregate class
    - Not responsible for creating/destroying parts

 * QUIZ:
 * Would you be more likely to implement the following as a composition or an aggregation?
    a) A ball that has a color - Composition: Color is an intrinsic property of a ball.
    b) An employer that is employing multiple people - Aggregation: An employer doesn’t start with any employees and hopefully doesn’t destroy all its 
    employees when it goes bankrupt. 
    c) The departments in a university - Composition: Departments can’t exist in absence of a university.
    d) Your age - Composition: Your age is an intrinsic property of you.
    e) A bag of marbles - Aggregation: The bag and the marbles inside have independent existences.

 * BEST:PRACTICE::
 * Implement the simplest relationship type that meets the needs of your program, not what seems right in real-life.
