# What type of relationship (composition, aggregation, association, or dependency) do the following describe?
## a) An Animal class that contains an animal type (enum) and name (string).
## Ans: Composition -- The animal type and name don’t have a use outside of the Animal.

## 1b) A text editor class with a save() function that takes a File object as an argument. The save() function writes the contents of the editor to disk.
